## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a portfolio project that demonstrates my abilities in building a Java-based application that uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect with a MySQL database. The project involves creating a "Book-Shop" database, storing book information such as book name, edition, and price, and performing various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Set up your development environment
Create your MySQL database and tables
Create a new Java project in Eclipse
Add the JDBC driver to your project
Create a new JFrame form using Windows Builder
Add GUI components to the JFrame form
Implement the CRUD operations in your Java code
Test your application..

### Prerequisites
To run the Book Shop project using JDBC and MySQL in Eclipse IDE with a Windows Builder application window, 
the following prerequisites are required:
JDK (Java Development Kit) version 17 or higher
Eclipse IDE with the Window Builder plugin installed
MySQL server installed on your local machine or on a remote server that you have access to
JDBC driver for MySQL downloaded and added to your project's classpath

### Installing
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Open Eclipse and import the project as a Java project
3. Add the JDBC driver to the project's classpath
4. Run the `JavaCrud.java` file to start the application 

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
First Go into Eclipse IDE and you can run the program using Java Application Right click on project and run as java apllication.
load the JDBC driver after it automatically establish connection then application Window are open . 

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
This is CRUD operation project you can use it to store Books Data  stores Many No of 
Books information i.e Book name its Edition and its Price He Display all of that Data with List. And 
Also Make Many Operations On it He can Save Book Data , Update the Book Data , Delete the Book 
Data and Clear the Book Data .

### Features
This project allows you to:
- Add new books to the database
- Edit existing books in the database
- Delete books from the database
- View a list of all books in the database

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
First Extract the file from GitHub and import it into eclipse IDE and you can run the program, So that it will automatically generate the database table and then you can run the code in eclipse IDE.
Also You can deploy the Book Shop project on your local machine by setting up a MySQL server and running the application on your machine.
